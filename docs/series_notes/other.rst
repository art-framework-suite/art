Platform/compiler support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This series is the first to support macOS Mojave. As of art 3.02.00, art will no longer support macOS Sierra. 
In addition, the following compilers have been introduced for art 3.02.00:

* GCC 8.2.0 with C++17 enabled (e19 qualifier)
* Clang 7.0.0 with C++17 enabled (c2 qualifier)

See here for more detailed information about primary qualifiers.


Python 3 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This series is the first to support Python 3, allowing users roughly 1 year to switch to Python 3 before the Python 2's end-of-life of January 1, 2020. 
Note that for technical reasons, Python 3 builds are not available for SLF6 platforms. 
In addition, the fhicl Python extension module is only supported for version 3.02.03 and newer.
