# This test takes two input files from a primary process and dumps
# their event numbers.  It then runs a no-merge job where the products
# in the primary files are persisted to some output files (the
# secondary files) that correspond exactly to the events in each file.
# The event IDs are dumped for the secondary files.  The event
# printout is diffed between primary and secondary files to ensure
# that there is a one-to-one correspondence of output files to input
# files.

# Dump info from first file
