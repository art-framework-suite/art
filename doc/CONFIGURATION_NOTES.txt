Notes on the use of FHiCL to configure framework executables
============================================================

The original version of the *art* framework executable was configured
using the Python configuration system inherited from CMS. We have
replaced that using FHiCL.

Below is a sample of how we propose to use FHiCL to configure the
framework executable. A real experiment would likely have some of
these values supplied by files that are #include'd into the
configuration file. Our example does not make any such use.

::

  # The "process" parameter is optional. The default is "DEFAULT"
  process_name: SAMPLE

  # The "source" block is optional. If it is missing, an EmptySource
  # that emits one event, labeled as run 1, subrun 1, event 1 is
  # produced.
  source: { ... }

  # The "services" block is optional, as is each block inside it.  The
  # framework provides default settings that are used if nothing is
  # provided by the user.
  services:
  {
    # The following services are always created;
    # default configurations are provided if none is given.
    floating_point_control: { ... }
    message:                { ... }
    trigger_names:          { ... }

    # The following services are created only when
    # the user requests their creation, by including a
    # block here. If the corresponding services provides
    # complete default configuration, the associated block
    # can be empty.
    SimpleMemoryCheck:                 { ... }
    TFileService:                  { ... }
    Timing:                 { ... }

    services: {
      # Experiment- or user-defined service configurations
      # go here
    }

    scheduler:
    {
      Rethrow: [OtherCMS, StdException, Unknown, BadAlloc,
                BadExceptionType, ProductNotFound, DictionaryNotFound,
                InsertFailure, Configuration, LogicError, UnimplementedFeature,
                InvalidReference, NullPointerError, NoProductSpecified, EventTimeout,
                EventCorruption, ScheduleExecutionFailure, EventProcessorFailure,
                FileInPathError, FileOpenError, FileReadError, FatalRootError,
                MismatchedInputFiles, ProductDoesNotSupportViews,
                ProductDoesNotSupportPtr, NotFound]
      Ignore: []
      wantSummary: true
      fileMode: FULLMERGE

      handleEmptyRuns:    true
      handleEmptySubRuns: true

      maxEvents:  -1
      maxSubRuns: -1

      enableSigInt: true
      unloadRootSigHandler: false
      resetRootErrHandler: true
      wantTracer: false
    }
  }

  # The "physics" block is optional.
  # The default analyzers, filters and producers are empty parameter sets.
  #  The default trigger_paths and end_paths are empty sequences.
  physics:
  {
     analyzers: { ... }
     filters:   { ... }
     producers: { ... }

     # The following are needed now, but this need may be temporary.
     trigger_paths: [ ... ]
     end_paths:     [ ... ]
  }

  # The "outputs" block is optional.
  outputs: 
  {
    ....
  }

  # The following are currently required, but will probably be removed
  # in a later version of art.
  all_modules: [ ... ]
  all_sources: [ source ]
  paths: [ ... ]

Historical Notes
================

CMS has *forced services* where we have *facilities*. 

The CMS *CurrentModuleService* has no configurable parameters, and
must be present. Because it has no parameters to configure, and
because it is always created, there is no reason for us to have a
"current_module_facility" configuration element in the configuration
file.

The automatic loading of Root class information on demand
and the initial loading of *all* dictionary libraries used to be
optional and configurable: this is no longer the case.
