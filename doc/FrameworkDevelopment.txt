Making the framework build using the new externals structure.
Packages are installed in the externals directory via upd.
Libraries and headers are in subdirectories associated with each product.
You setup fw_externals to get the appropriate set of packages.

To make a test build of this branch:

ssh -l fwdev patlxlg or patvm2 (SLF4 machines)
Make a new playground directory:
mkdir -p /archives/fwdev/playground/tN,
 where N is some integer 
cd tN
svn checkout https://oink/mu2e/branches/new-externals

source /archives/fwdev/flxi-externals/setup
setup fw_externals 
source new-externals/bin/setup_fw.sh
cd new-externals
scons

Changes so far: replace all occurances of MU2E with FW
