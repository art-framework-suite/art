What is  art?
=============

The **art** event processing framework coordinates *event processing*
via configurable, pluggable modules (*e.g.*, reconstruction,
filtering, and analysis) that add data to and retrieve data from
events, supporting a programming model that separates algorithm and
data.

An *event* is one unit of data. It may represent an interaction, a
beam crossing, or any period of collected data. Each experiment that
uses the **art** framework can define the unit of data that
corresponds to the *event* as it wishes.

The art framework
=================

This tutorial introduces the most important elements of the **art** framework. It is a work in progress.

Key concepts of the art framework
=================================

Data-related
------------

* **Event Data Model**: Representation of the data that an experiment collects, all derived information,
  and historical records necessary for reproduction of results.

* **Data Products**: Experiment defined classes that represent detector signals, reconstruction results,
  simulation, etc..

* **Event**: A collection of data products associated with one time window, the smallest
   unit of detector data collection to be processed.

* **SubRun**: A period of data collection in which operating conditions do not change.

* **Run**: A period of data collection, defined by the experiment.

* **Provenance**: Metadata describing how data products were produced.

Processing-related
------------------

* **Configuration**: Structured documents describing all processing aspects of a single job
  including setting of parameters and workflow specification.

* **Module**: An object (in C++) that “plugs into" a processing stream and performs a specific task on
  units of data obtained using the Event Data Model, independent of other running modules.

* **Event Processor**: An object that utilizes a configuration document to dynamically schedule sequences
  of modules to process data using the event data model.

* **Services**: A global facility that is dependent on the state of the application and that can
  be accessed from any module.

* **Process Name**: User-assigned name representing the kind of processing that a job is affiliated
  with, such as reconstruction, testing, filtering.

EDM: the Event Data Model
=========================

* Library for organizing, navigating, and persisting data processed by the experiment

* Organization is hierarchical: *Run* / *SubRun* / *Event*

* Processing happens one Event at a time

* The EDM at the lowest level appears as a small database holding data
  products generated (collected or derived) for the associated data
  taking period

* Modules perform queries to find existing data objects and do inserts
  to store new data products associated with this Event


Data Products
=============

* Almost all C++ objects can be stored into an *Event* (the objects must not contain bare pointers)

* Most products will be **collections**

* Navigation classes provide the replacement for bare pointers

* There are many ways to "label" the products to allow for later queries by processing elements

* Each data product has a configurable label that can be used in downstream processing queries

* The build system must be told which classes are stored in the *Event*, and must generate "dictionaries"
  which are used to support persistency in Root files.


Modules
=======

* These are the user-written processing elements of the system. Each has its own configuration.

* Each module processes one *Event* at a time.

* Four types of modules:
  1. **Producers** - request data products, insert new data products
  2. **Filters** - request data products and can alter further processing using return values
  3. **Analyzers** - request data products, do not create new ones; make histograms, etc.
  4. **Output** - store data products to files (provided by framework)


Sources
=======

* **Source** - provide the stream of Events (e.g. from file)

* New ones be provided by experiment without new **art** release

* Different classes for different tasks:

  * *RootInput*: reads **art** format Root files
  * *NOvARawInputSource*: experiment-specfic source that reads binary DAQ files (provided by framework group)
  * *EmpyEvent*: creates *Events* containing no products (used, e.g., in simulation)

Filter Interface
================

    class EDFilter {
      // explicit EDFilter(ParameterSet const&)

      virtual bool filter(Event&) = 0

      virtual void beginJob()
      virtual void endJob()
      virtual bool beginRun(Run &)
      virtual bool endRun(Run &)
      virtual bool beginSubRun(SubRun &)
      virtual bool endSubRun(SubRun &)

      virtual void respondToOpenInputFile(FileBlock const& fb)
      virtual void respondToCloseInputFile(FileBlock const& fb)
      virtual void respondToOpenOutputFiles(FileBlock const& fb)
      virtual void respondToCloseOutputFiles(FileBlock const& fb)
    }


Analyzer Interface
==================

    class EDAnalyzer {
      // explicit EDAnalyzer(ParameterSet const&)

      virtual void analyze(Event const&) = 0

      virtual void beginJob()
      virtual void endJob()
      virtual bool beginRun(Run const &)
      virtual bool endRun(Run const &)
      virtual bool beginSubRun(SubRun const &)
      virtual bool endSubRun(SubRun const &)

      virtual void respondToOpenInputFile(FileBlock const& fb)
      virtual void respondToCloseInputFile(FileBlock const& fb)
      virtual void respondToOpenOutputFiles(FileBlock const& fb)
      virtual void respondToCloseOutputFiles(FileBlock const& fb)
    }


Services
========

* *TFile*: Controls the ROOT directories (one per module) and manages the histogram file.
* *Timing*: Tracks CPU and wall clock time for each module for each event
* *Memory*: Tracks increases in overall program memory on each module invocation
* *FloatingPointControl*: Allows configuration of FPU hardware “exception” processing
* (*RandomNumberService*): Manages the state of a random number stream for each interested module
* (*MessageFacility*): Routes user-emitted messages from modules based on type and severity to destinations

Access interface

        }
        END_PROLOG



Output Filtering
================

* Any output module can be configured to write out only those events
  passing a given *trigger path*; this is controlled by the parameter
  _SelectEvents_, as shown in the example below.

* Any output module can be configured to write out only those branches
  of interest; this is controlled by the parameter _outputCommands_, as
  shown in the example below.

      # this is only a fragment of a full configuration ...
      physics:
      {
        pathA: [ ... ]  # producers and filters are put in this path
        pathB: [ ... ]  # other producers, other filters are put in this path

        outA: [ passWriter ] # output modules and analyzers are put in this path
        outB: [ failWriter ] # output modules and analyzers are put in this path
        outC: [ exceptWriter ] # output modules and analyzers are put in this path

        trigger_paths: [ pathA, pathB ] # declare that these are "trigger paths"
        end_paths: [ outA outB outC ]   # declare these are "end paths"
      }

      outputs:
      {
        passWriter:
        {
          module_type: RootOutput
          fileName: "pathA_passes.root"
          # Write all the events for which pathA ended with 'true' from filtering.
          # Events which caused an exception throw will not be written.
          SelectEvents: { SelectEvents: [ "pathA&noexeception" ] }
          # Drop all branches, except those containing products created
          # by a producer with module label 'valuable':
          outputCommands: [ "drop *", "keep *_valuable_*_*" ]
        }
        failWriter:
        {
          module_type: RootOutput
          fileName: "pathA_failures.root"
          # Write all the events for which pathA ended with 'false' from filtering.
          # Events which caused an exception throw will not be written.
          SelectEvents: { SelectEvents: [ "!pathA&noexception" ] }
          # Keep all branches, except those containing products with
          # 'friendly class name' of 'UninterestingThings'
          outputCommands: [ "keep *", "drop UninterestingThings_*_*_*" ]
        }
        exceptWriter:
        {
          module_type: RootOutput
          fileName: "pathA_exceptions.root"
          # Write all the events for which pathA or pathB ended because an exception was thrown.
          SelectEvents: { SelectEvents: [ "exception@pathA", "exception@pathB" ] }
          # No outputCommands means that all branches are written for
          # these events.
        }
      }

Verifying FHiCL Files
=====================

* The command line executables (**art**, **nova**, *etc*.) can be used
  to process a configuration file, to do post-processing according to
  the specified command-line arguments, and to print out the FHiCL
  language representation of the configuration. To use this, define
  the environment variable ART_DEBUG_CONFIG. For example, if you are
  using the *bash* shell:

       ART_DEBUG_CONFIG=1 nova -c my_file.fcl

  If you wish to write the post-processed configuration to a file instead
  of the screen, specify a value for ART_DEBUG_CONFIG that starts with a
  letter, such as:

       ART_DEBUG_CONFIG=debug.fcl nova -c my_file.fcl

nova Command Line Arguments
============================

* Everything has a reasonable default.

* Values on the command line override values in the configuration document.
